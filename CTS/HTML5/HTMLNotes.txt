=============

1)Live server plugin extension installation.

Lists
=====
HTML provides provides 3 types of Lists
1)ordered Lists(ol)
2)un ordered Lists(ul)
3)description lists(dl)

1)ordered Lists(ol)
===================
<ol> generates a serial no for each and every list item.

By default that serial nos are : 1, 2, 3 ...

<ol>
    <li>Ramu</li>
    <li>Anil</li>
    <li>Vijay</li>
</ol>

2)un ordered Lists(ul):
    <ul> generates bullets for each and every list item.


<ul>
    <li>Ramu</li>
    <li>Anil</li>
    <li>Vijay</li>
</ul>

What is the difference between <ol> and <ul>

1)ol generates serial no for each and ever list item
2) By default this serial no is 1, 2, 3, etc.

3)there is a possibility we can generate these serial no, 
in different formats also.

    1)A, B, C, etc
    2)a, b, c ..... etc
    3)I, II, II, IV ...etc
    4)i, ii, iii, iv, v.... etc

4)we can generate these formats by using type="" attribute.
Ex: type="A"    

<ul>
=====
Incase of un ordered list also , we can generate various different styles for list items.

1)disc
2)circle
3)square
4)none



When to use <ol> and <ul>?
=========================
Suppose If our requirement is , list items must be displayed 
with some serial nos at that time we show go with <ol>

Here serial no , demands order of list items.

ul:
If list items does not have any priority, at that time
we should go with un ordered list.


Description lists;(dl)
====================
<dl>
    <dt>title<dd>
    <dd>option 1<dl>

dl = description list
dt = description title
dd = description definition
