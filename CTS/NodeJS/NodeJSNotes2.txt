NodeJS 
========
NodeJS is a technology which is used to develop server based applications 
by using javascript.

Basically java script is loaded in client browsers and there it self executed.
Usually js wont executed out side of browsers. 

But bz of NodeJS, js is executed out side of browsers also.

Suppose if we are developping js files for the purpose of NodeJS, 
So at that time, we should not write use window, document objects.
Bz Nojejs Engine not supports window and documents objects.


The main idea of Node JS is, to make it execute javascript out side of browser engines.
To meet this require ments, NodeJS is developed by extracting Chrome V8 Engine from Chrome 
Browsers.

The main archetecture of NodeJS or core concepts of Nodejs is 
1)Chrome V8 
2)libUV 


1)Chrome V8 : is used to execute js files out side of browser 
2)libUV : is used to develop multi processing programming at server side application


In current market, Nodejs is one the fastest server based applicaiton.

To working NodeJS , first we should installl NodeJS.
Its official web site is : nodejs.org 
Its first version is released in 2009
Its current latest version is : 16

after installing NodeJS, Following impoortant tools will be installed 

1)node 
2)npm 
3)npx 

1)node : By using this tool we can execute js files out side of browser. 
2)npm : it is a tool which can perform a veriaty of operatons. 
    like project creation, libraries installations of project, project running, project testing,
    project building etc. 
3)npx : by using it we create react js project , we start json-server etc.

Note: 
    what ever we used or learned while developping java script, every thing can be 
    used at it is in node js programming except window, and documnt like DOM manipulations


Ex: 
    Operators 
    1)Arithmetic operators 
    2)Relational Operators 
    3)Logical Operators 

And basic programming concepts of js can be used as it in Nodejs programmng.
    Ex:     if
            if-else 
            looping 
            while, do-while, for loop, for in , for of
            switch 

            arrays 
            object 
            string 
            function programming 

basically nodejs is developped by considering ES6 standards.



Note: in case of Nodejs, usually file extension is .js 

REPL Terminal: read–evaluate–print loop
It is one of the greates feature of V8 Engine.
which is used to perform basice operations

Major Topics In NodeJS 
=========================
1) http programming : by using http programming we can achieve client - server communication 
2) db communication programming  
    mysql, mongo db, post grace etc 
3)file syste programming woring with files 
    etc     

Nodejs Project/application set up 
======================================
1) npm init 
    it generates a package.json 

Global Objects,
================
usually it is called as globals 
global object might be a variable, or function, a class or object

The things which can be usable with out import in side js files 
those objects are called as globals.

1)console.log();
2)setTimeout, clearTimeout 
3)setInterval, clearInteval
4)setImmediate, clearImmediate
5)__dirname , __filename 
6)require 
7)module 
8)export 
9)process 
10)url 
11)url search params 
12)Buffer 
13)Event     


    5)__dirname : it is a variable which holds current folder  path
    , __filename : it is a variable, which holds current file path. 


process: 
    is used to get enviroment details or variables 
    process.env.    


module
=======
module is a one global object in nodejs .
it is playing a vital role in node js project 
to develop the application in the form of modules 
by improving modularity of applicatin and reusability

variable:
    __dirname, __filename 

functions: 
    setTimeout, clearTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval,
    setImmediate, clearImmediate, 
    require 
class: 
    Buffer
object: 
    console 
    module 
    process 


global object 
modules 

call backs 

working with mongodb 
====================
Note: to work with mongodb, first we should install mongodb library;

npm i mongo  

Note2: to working with mongodb, mongodb server shouldb be in running mode.

Usually it runns on 27017 port .

If we are working with local mongo, 
then in that case it url to connect server is 
    let url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/'
    let url = 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/'

Note3: to work with mongodb, 
first we should impoet 'mongodb' lib.

============
http module 
working with http module 
======================= 
by using http modules, we develop client -server 
communication based back end application.

steps to create server application by using http 
==================================================
1)import http module 
2)create server 
3)register the server with port 
4)develop routes 


Angular : 4200
ReactJS : 3000
NodeJS :  5000
MongoDB : 27017

port configuration as environment variable 
===========================================
working with parameters 
to work with parameters we should take help url module.


by using http developping rest api application is very dificult.
To over come this problem , solution is provided in the form of express js framework.

So to work with expresjs we must installl express js 

npm i express

nodemon
==========
Note: while working with server applications http, 
for each and every modification, to make it effect the changes to server,
we should stop the server and restart.
this is very difficult approach to restart server for every small changes.

To over come this problem automatically restart the server for every modifications
we are going to take the help of nodemon.
we should install it at global location ( -g)

npm i -g nodemon

steps to work with express 
===========================
1)import express 
2) cerate app variable for express(); 
3)call http method for respective paths using app variable 
4)register app with particular port to make application listen requests 

working with params 
========================

important properties of req object 
===================================
1)params 
2)query 
3)body
baseUrl 
originalUrl 
route
method 
url 
headers

Note: 
By using http get method, body is not generated. 
to generate body we should send post requests 


tomorrow we can develop fullfledged rest api by integrating mongodb, ans as well as front end 
react js app
