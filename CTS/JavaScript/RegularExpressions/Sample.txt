A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other
strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern.
Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world.

The module re provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python. 
The re module raises the exception re.error if an error occurs while compiling or using a regular expression.

We would cover two important functions, which would be used to handle regular expressions.
Nevertheless, a small thing first: There are various characters, which would have special meaning when
they are used in regular expression. To Avoid any confusion while dealing with regular
 expressions, we would use Raw Strings as r'expression'. 5 3 2 34 55 88 659 9875 25 3 6 45 852
